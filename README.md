You can signup for an account by going to [this](https://accounts.google.com/signin) page and selecting "Create account".  If you already have a gmail account this can also be used.

## Instruqt account

You'll need to setup an account in Instruqt, which can be done [here](https://play.instruqt.com/signup).
In order to give you access to the course material, please share the mail address used to setup the account with the trainers.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account

If you already have a Gmail account, congratulations üéâ, you have a Google Cloud Platform account!  Please share the corresponding mail with the trainers.  

Signing up for a GCP account can be done [here](https://accounts.google.com/signin) (select "Create account")

## Local Machine setup

Installation instructions for the technologies:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
- [gcloud kubectl plugin](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin).

### gcloud setup

`gcloud` installation can be a bit fiddly but generally goes as follows:
1. Download the package for your system and extract the files
2. Run the install script using `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`
3. Install the required `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`, instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin)
4. Open a new terminal instance
5. Authenticate with `gcloud auth login`

If you have any issues with the setup, not to worry, we'll help get you setup at the training.

## Google Cloud Shell

If you have any issues with the above setup on your local machine, consider using Google Cloud Shell. 
It provides a cloud version of VS Code with access to all required Docker tooling.

Setup instructions are as follows:

1. Ensure you have a Google Cloud Platform account

2. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com

3. Select "Activate Cloud Shell"

4. Select Open editor

   ![image-20220923084933592](images/README/image-20220923084933592.png)

5. Select Open in New Window

    ![image-20210428212837270](images/README/image-20210428212837270.png)

You should now be able to see a code editor environment much like VS Code.  To access a terminal, select "Terminal"->"New Terminal"

Important to note is that your Cloud Shell instance will be put to sleep after 20 minutes of inactivity.  Starting it back up again takes a few seconds.
